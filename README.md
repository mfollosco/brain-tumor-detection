# our dataset structure is as follows:

  └──brain-tumor
      
      └──train
        
        └──images

To set up the structure, simply download the files dataset from this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ultralytics/brain-tumor/data, and unzip the folder, placing this in your folder for these notebooks.

The binary_image_classification folder contains notebooks for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and YOLO. The other remaining files in the root directory are for CNN and GradCAM.
